# USB-C UPDI

Programming via the megaTinyCore library, enabling your IDE for serial UPDI programming via a portable python implementation and temporary hardware, or one of two designated serial programmer options. Each UPDI serial programmer enables switching between serial programming and monitoring without any rewiring.

The USB-C UPDI is still in development and facing some supply chain delays. See the programmer's [Documentation Page](https://teddywarner.org/Projects/SerialUPDI/#usb-c-updi-design) for progress!
